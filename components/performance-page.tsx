      <h1>Performance Metrics</h1>
      <p>Here's an overview of our key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>

      <h2>Click-Through Rate (CTR)</h2>
      <p>
        CTR measures the percentage of users who click on a specific link out of the total number of users who view a
        page, email, or advertisement. A higher CTR generally indicates more effective content.
      </p>
      <p>CTR &gt;5% is considered excellent.</p>
      <p>CTR &lt;1% may indicate a need for improvement.</p>

      <h2>Conversion Rate</h2>
      <p>
        Conversion rate measures the percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., making a purchase, signing
        up for a newsletter) out of the total number of users who visit a website or landing page.
      </p>
      <p>A conversion rate of {2 - 5}% is generally considered good for e-commerce.</p>

      <h2>Bounce Rate</h2>
      <p>
        Bounce rate measures the percentage of users who leave a website after viewing only one page. A high bounce rate
        may indicate that the content is not relevant or engaging to users.
      </p>
      <p>A bounce rate &gt;70% may indicate a problem with the website's content or user experience.</p>
      <p>A bounce rate &lt;40% is generally considered good.</p>

      <h2>Average Session Duration</h2>
      <p>
        Average session duration measures the average amount of time users spend on a website during a single session. A
        longer session duration may indicate that users are finding the content engaging and valuable.
      </p>

      <h2>Page Views per Session</h2>
      <p>
        Page views per session measures the average number of pages users view during a single session. A higher number
        of page views per session may indicate that users are exploring the website and finding the content relevant.
